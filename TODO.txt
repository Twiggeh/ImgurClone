posts should contain a userid instead of a username and userpicture

rethink how scripts are being used/ built

Server doesn't start because of missing cert/priv_key && cert/fullchain

Server doesn't get secure server port

Server doesn't read .env file ?

Inputting lines into readline doesnt work when its spawned from another process (need to 
pass stdin)

Server doesn't work at all after being built from a setup script - just loads .localhost 
for whatever reason
